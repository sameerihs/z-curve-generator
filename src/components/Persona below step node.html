Persona below step node
Fix Z-curve-> hover modal, add legends, reduce line weight, reduce numbers from name, try increaing y-levels, fix 3rd line node placement algo, add icon, add word wrap in step name

KPI-> reduce to 4, 2x2, lower the arrow near the metric value, reduce the strngth of color, add word wrap for BO names, rename to BO indicator



NOTE: If you have to edit any file, use search and replace method to avoid errors.

I need you to make the following changes in the Command Center View:
1. In the hover modal, i want the step name, the description, Type (Manual, Automated, Automatable), ESSA Type
2. Below the node, I want the Persona to be visible, below that I want the Tools list in a line.
3. reduce the line weight of the z-curve a lil bit.
4. remove numbers in step name in the Z curve, i want just name
5. Add text wrap in the step name, (after 2 words, the next word should go to the next line)
6. Below the Z-curve, beside the 2 button (ARIS and Celonis), I want a legend, Manual is Orange Bordered circle, partially automated should be Amber circle, and automated is Green circle.
7. Also currently the hover modal is broken. It has to be on top of everything in the UI. I.e its layer has to be above all the other layers when I hover over a step.

I want you to make the following changes in the KPI Section:
1. Current the gauge colors are as such:
  const data = [
    { name: 'Good', value: 60, color: '#10b981' }, // Green
    { name: 'Warning', value: 25, color: '#f59e0b' }, // Yellow
    { name: 'Critical', value: 15, color: '#ef4444' }, // Red
  ];

  Make it lighter version of this to make it look more minimal and modern.
2. Replace the kpisTop and kpisBottom data with the following but follow the same list/nested format, just change the data values:
 
P2P	Invoice to Pay	NORTH AMERICA	Days payable outstanding	70.3	60	Procure to Pay	202503
P2P	Invoice to Pay	NORTH AMERICA	% paid on time	48.4	95	Procure to Pay	202503
P2P	Invoice to Pay	NORTH AMERICA	% Invoices created automatically	28.8	32	Procure to Pay	202503
P2P	Invoice to Pay	NORTH AMERICA	% invoices with exception	11	5	Procure to Pay	202503
P2P	Invoice to Pay	EUROPE	Days payable outstanding	57.9	60	Procure to Pay	202503
P2P	Invoice to Pay	EUROPE	% paid on time	30.8	95	Procure to Pay	202503
P2P	Invoice to Pay	EUROPE	% Invoices created automatically	2.1	32	Procure to Pay	202503
P2P	Invoice to Pay	EUROPE	% invoices with exception	28.6	5	Procure to Pay	202503
 

3. Remove the header which currently reads North America Process and Europe Process.
4. I want a 2 by 2 layout in the KPI Section. Increase the gauge size.
5. I want the red/green arrow with the +/- % value beside the KPI metric value (eg 8.2d), not on the top.
6. Add word wrap here as well for the metric name.

I want you to make the following changes in the Z-Curve section:
1. the hard coded data you pass should be topProcess and bottomProcess, not euProcess and naProcess.
2. Secondly in this hard coded data, apart from title and description, I also want you to populate Type, ESSA Type, Persona and Tools.
3. In the Z-curve, I want the persona to be mentioned below the node. and below persona i want Tools as well.
4. Also the hover overlay is still broken. I want it on top of everything. Currently the neighboring steps' name is visible from the hovered modal.
5. Make the gauge chart more bigger.
6. Also Days payable outcome arrow should be down and red.
7. Based on the ESSA Type of the step, the border color of the node has to change.

I want the following changes in the AI comparison feature, the current modal and implementation works perfectly.
1. When the compare with PepGPT Button is clicked, I want 3 modals to open up on the screen. The left one is for the Process Comparison Analysis, middle one is the modal for Business outcome analysis, the third/right modal is for Transformation Initiatives Analysis. I want you to try and see if it possible to hit 3 different calls to gemini with different prompts. For transformation Initiatives, you can pass the below hard coded data:

2. Secondly in each of the 3 modals, I want a button at the bottom right which says "View Detailed Analysis", which should further make another call to gemini with 500 word analysis. The initial normal analysis can be of 150 words.
3. I want you to follow a clean, minimal UI with b/w theme. NO USE OF GRADIENT AT ALL.
4. Make these modals responsive to other screen sizes.

NOTE: If you have to edit any file, use search and replace method to avoid errors.
I want you to make the following changes:
1. Remove Tools below the node. Only perosna is enough. Make the text color of persona as blue.
2. Make SAP Check step automated and Clear Invoice as Partially Automated.
3. Also ESSA Type should either me Eliminate, Simplify, Standardize or Automate only, not E1,A2 etc

I want you to make the following changes in the AI feature:
1. Currently all the 3 modals are opening in the center one on top of each other. Let's do one thing, Let's have one main modal, and in that we can have 3 columns/section. See how you can make it look sleek, modern and cool without using any gradients. Have one common button in the bottom left "View Detailed", which when clicked will show the detailed analysis of all 3.

NOTE: If you have to edit any file, use search and replace method to avoid errors.

I want you to make the following changes:
1. When i click on the view detailed view, i want the same 3-column set up but the prompt should be of detailed view. I dont want a single response when i click that button.
2. I want to place small icons in the white section of the node's circle. if the step is Automated, put something robotic, if its manual, show something manual, if its partially automated, similarly show something aproproate.
3. Also in the KPI Section, the metric needs to have a type, day, percentage etc. If the data has day, mention day/s, if not mention percentage.

NOTE: If you have to edit any file, use search and replace method to avoid errors.


NOTE: If you have to edit any file, use search and replace method to avoid errors.
1. Add scrolling button in the detailed analysis view.
2. Secondly, the detailed analysis view takes a long time to load. I think it updates the view only after all the responses are fetched. Can you try to implement such that once the process comparison is received, we show that simultaneosly.
3. The placement of Icons in the node is also very weird. I want black medium sized icons which are center aligned in the node's white part. Also use better icons for partially automated and automated
NOTE: If you have to edit any file, use search and replace method to avoid errors.


1. Remove Partially Automated everywhere, it isn't supposed to exist.
2. 


NOTE: If you have to edit any file, use search and replace method to avoid errors.

I want you to make the following changes:
1. In the main mindmap view, on the top I want a floating capsule, which basically should allow me to toggle between 3 views. This floating capsule has to be modern, minimal, sleek without any gradients. The mindmap view I have, should be the first BO View, Second should be the Transformation Initiative View (where TI node is in center), Third should be the Process Step View (where Process steps are in the center).
2. I want you to make similar views for the other 2 based on the first view we already have.
3. Also currently the hard coded data is being read from mindmap.jsx, I dont want that. I want the data for all 3 views to be ready fom data.js. Remove everything that is there in data.js and first add the data for the first view from mindmap.jsx and then add the data for the other 2 views.

NOTE: If you have to edit any file, use search and replace method to avoid errors.

1. The colors of the sub nodes need to be of lighter color palatte.
2. Currently the font size of the text in the sub nodes is too big and it doesn't fit inside the node.
3. Also I dont want the floating capsule to be in the Nav bar. I want it fixed on the top right-ish in the reactflow mindmap section only.
4. Also, In the mindmap, change the entire color palette to something modern, minimal, sleek, not too much on the eye, nothing too strong. Do not use gradients at all.


NOTE: If you have to edit any file, use search and replace method to avoid errors.


NOTE: If you have to edit any file, use search_replace method to avoid errors.

I want the following changes to be made:
1. The color palette is too dull and is almost not visible clearly. So I want you to use mild/light colors. Something professional, but slightly colorful.
2. Similarly make the color changes in the edges and floating capsule as well.
3. In the Z-curve, if a step is Automated, do not show the Persona below the node.

NOTE: If you have to edit any file, use search_replace method to avoid errors.


NOTE: If you have to edit any file, use search_replace method to avoid errors.
The current UI theme and color palette is perfect, follow the same thing.
I want you to make the following changes:
1. I want the Z-curve to be on the right and its position will be there only freezed. And on the left I can have all the processes forms etc. Dowload option can be moved to below the Z curve on the right.
2. Currenty the StepForm Component is too big. I was thinking what if we make it such that we have 3 in one row kinda card. This card will have some details and 2 buttons "View" and "Edit". When I click on View, I can see it as a modal popup, same modal will be shown when I click Edit but input fields are editable.
3. When I click on + Add Step, I need a similar modal which I have when I click Edit but all fields need to be empty.
4. I want the UI to be clean, modern, minimal, sleek and DO NOT USE ANY GRADIENTS.
5. Also when I generate the Image/SVG, I need the step name to auto wrap after 3 words. Also use a better professional font in the Z-curve image and in the SVG.
6. Also I want to be able to drag the step card component up and down, so I can easily re-arrange the steps, the same should update on the Z-curve as well.

I want you to do the following changes:
1. Understand the entire all_api_endpoints.json, this has all the updated endpoints.
2. Let's start the backend integration in the adminView screens first.
3. Check the current implementation to fetch the process, subprocess, regions and markets.
4. Check the implementation in api.js, adminDashboardStore.js, and constants.js.
5. Also, when clicked on Add process, I want a similar modal that shows up when You click on edit process, and I want you to hit the right endpoints.
6. I want a clean, error handled code for all the api endpoint implementations. Even in UI I want a clean error, state handling of load etc.

I'm currently not getting any error in the console, but im unable to see any regions, markets when i toggle the dropdown.

I want you to fix the following things:
1. The Process dropdown is still broken i think, its not displaying the process items. The sub process, region and market dropdowns are working perfectly fine.
2. In the console log, i get this, fix this:
FilterSection.jsx:77 Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop.

Check the render method of `div`. It was passed a child from FilterSection. See https://react.dev/link/warning-keys for more information.

2. In the modal, I need a Add step button or a plus symbol to add next step. This should be vertically be added, and should be scrollable.

2. The persona and tools dropdown in add process modal is still broken, please go through the entire implementation and fix it. Try to follow a similar implementation to how you do for type and ESSA Type.
3. When I click on persona/tools, i see a long dropdown but its completely blank. I cant see the items.
4. Secondly, check the endpoint which is used to add a new tool or a new persona.

I want you to fix the following things:
1. In the Add Process Modal, in the Dropwdown bar, I can see all the Process items in the dropdown, but I can't see any sub-process in the dropdown. Why dont you hit the same end point you hit before in the adminDashboard? In fact you dont even have to hit the end point again, it should already be there right?
2. Secondly, Persona and Tools is still not visible. Can you try a completely different approach? Maybe as soon as the page loads (or when you initially load all the regions, process etc), at the same time why dont you GET all the persona and Tools list as well. And when I open any modal and in that when I open any dropdown, I can see it there instantaneously, instead of making a call again.
3. Thirdly go through the entire all_api_endpoints.json file again and see if we are hitting the right endpoints for adding steps in Z-curve etc.

Why dont you hit the same end point you hit before in the adminDashboard? In fact you dont even have to hit the end point again, it should already be there right?
2. Also in this same dropdown, we also need to have a mechanism which allows us to add a new process/sub-process. (This will be used in case the required process, sub-process is not in the list already)
3. Secondly, check the implementation of Save Changes button in the Modal, is it even hitting the right endpoint? Add some print statements so we can see the entire flow and see whats going wrong and where.

I want you to make the following changes:
1. I think there is something seriously wrong with the way you fetch the dropdown items for sub-process in the modals. The dropdown items for Process, Region, Market is perfectly coming up. Only Sub-process isn't coming along well. Can you please check the entire implementation for this and fix it. Try to have a similar approach as you did with process, region, market etc.
2. Secondly, in the console, I can see that a sub-process item, supplier onboarding is showing up, but not coming in the dropdown UI:
FilterSection props: {regions: Array(5), markets: Array(14), selectedRegion: 'all', selectedMarket: 'all', loading: {…}, …}
FilterSection.jsx:76 Rendering process option: {id: 1, name: 'P2P', hasConfigs: true}
FilterSection.jsx:76 Rendering process option: {id: 2, name: 'FP', hasConfigs: false}
FilterSection.jsx:76 Rendering process option: {id: 3, name: 'H2O', hasConfigs: false}
FilterSection.jsx:113 Rendering subprocess option: {id: 1, name: 'Supplier Onboarding'}

3. Also, when I click on Add new process, the 2 new fields that open up, I cant see any add process button. Similarly in sub process. Also, in persona and tools, the add new persona feature isn't working. Check the implementation. Similarly do for Tools as well.

1. Ok so, in the Admin Dashboard, here's the flow I think I want. When the user clicks on Add Process, I only need the filter for process and subprocess. I dont want the step forms, regions and martket and process owner. only when the user selects a process, I should get all the subprocess for those process in the filter. I still want to have the add new process and add new subprocess buttons in the dropdown. Make the UI better for adding a process and subprocess. 
2. When a new process is created, I want a new subprocess named "Overview" created with the process id of the new process created. ensure that this "Overview" is also shown in the sub process dropdown. So you first do GET all process, if I add a new process, you do POST process, POST sub process, then GET sub process for that process (get subprocess by process id). If i add a new sub process, you just do POST sub process for that process id.

Previously I had asked you to make the below changes/fix:
Fix the Broken Filters in Admin View
Task Objective:
Fix the broken filter functionality for Process, Sub-process, Region, and Market drop-downs in the Admin View.
Expected Behavior:
1. On clicking each filter, a corresponding GET API call must be made to fetch the data and populate the options.
2. Ensure the filter works independently and displays correct values.
Details:
• Refer to the API contract in the file: all_API_endpoints.json for all endpoint URLs, request formats, and response structures.
• Go through the entire existing implementation before applying changes—check where and how current endpoints are being called (to avoid duplicate or broken logic).
• State management must be done via Zustand.
UI Guidelines:
• Keep the UI minimal, sleek, and modern.
• No gradients or heavy styling—stick to flat design.
• Use clean dropdowns with intuitive placeholder text and loading indicators while fetching.

But I face the below errors:

Currenly, the Process filter dropdown is working perfectly fine but subprocess, region and market dropdowns are not working. I want you to fix the following things:
1. Ensure that when I click on the Process filter, it fetches all the processes and displays them in the dropdown.
2. When I click on the Sub-process filter, it should fetch all the sub-processes and display them in the dropdown.
3. When I click on the Region filter, it should fetch all the regions and display them in the dropdown.
4. When I click on the Market filter, it should fetch all the markets and display them in the dropdown.
5. For the table below, show entities from the subprocess-market-config endpoint

NOTE: If you have to edit any file, use search_replace method to avoid errors.
Check the entire implementation of the Admin Dashboard and ensure that the following API endpoints are being used correctly:
1. to get all process, get: /api/processes/active
2. to get all sub-process, get: /api/subprocesses/active
3. to get all regions, get: /api/lookup/regions/active
4. to get all markets, get: /api/lookup/markets/active
5. for the table, to get all "ZCurve", get: /api/subprocess-market-configs/active

This is good but I want you to make the following changes:
1. In the filter section, when I click on the Process filter, it should show all the processes in the dropdown. Currenty it is not showing any processes. Maybe add print statements to see if the API is being called correctly and if the response is being handled properly.
2. Similarly, when I click on the Sub-process filter, it should show all the sub-processes of that process in the dropdown.
3. Subprocess filter should only be enabled when a process is selected. If no process is selected, it should be disabled.
4. Similarly only when i click on region filter, it should enable the market filter and show all the markets of that region in the dropdown.

Use the below end points:
1.  /api/processes/active
2. /api/processes/active
3. /api/lookup/regions/active
4. /api/lookup/markets/region/{regionId}
